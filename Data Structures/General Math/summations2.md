When the value being added is constant,

\[
T(n)=\sum^{n}_{i=1}2
\]

You can simplify the summation using this formula,

\[
\sum^{n}_{i=1}c=c*n
\]

- c is the constant being added
- n is the number of terms in the summation

---

For adding a growing amount of integers, from 1 to n,

\[
\sum^{n}_{i=1}i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Say n is 6,

\[
\sum^{6}_{i=1}i=\frac{6(6+1)}{2}=\frac{6*7}{2}=21
\]

##### Comparing the two formulas


\(\sum^{n}_{i=1}c=c*n
\)

- Used when adding a constant value repeatedly
- For example, \(n = 6\) gives \(2*6=12\)

\(\sum^{n}_{i=1}i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\)
- Used for summing the integers from 1 to n
- For example, \(n = 6\) gives \(21\)
