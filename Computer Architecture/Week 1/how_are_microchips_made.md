#### Intro
- This microchip can take up to 26 weeks to make
- In it hundreds of layers, billions of transistors
are packed into an area aobut the size of a fingernal
- They are the brains in everything we use electronically

#### How's it made?
- We start with silicon
- Silicon is a semi-conductor, a sweet spot in between
an insulator and pure conductor
  - This means its properties such as its conductivity
  can be altered by adding impurities or doping to
  meet the needs of different electronic devices
  - This also allows us to control the electrical
  signals that pass through
- Silicon is also abundant, it's one of the 10 most
common elements found on Earth, but most of the
silicon found in the wild is chemically bound to
oxygen, so they must be seperated

#### Continuation
- Once the silicon is processed, a seed crystal is
placed in contact with the pure molten silicon,
silicon atoms are deposited on the bottom surface
of the crystal
- The result is a boule, a single-crystal ingot of
pure silicon
  - The boule is then thinly sliced into wafers
- Silicon wafers have varying diameter, usually
about 1-12 inches (2.5 - 30.5 Centimeters)
  - The most state of the art facilities are able
  to produce wafers up to 18 inches in diameter
- Bigger wafers are able to yield more microchips

#### Microchips
- Microchips are made in extremely sterile conditions,
free from contaminants such as dust
  - If even just one particle of dust makes its way
  onto a silicon wafer, the entire batch is at risk
  of being ruined
    - This would derail a process that can take an
    average of 12 weeks

#### First step
- The first step of the production process is
deposition, a thin non-conduction layer of silicon
dioxide is grown or deposited on the surface of the
wafer
- Then the silicon wafer is prepared for lithography
by coating it with photosensitive and light resistant
materials
- The next step is critical

#### Exposure
- The prepared silicon wafers enter a lithography
machine and are exposed to UV light passed through
a reticle containing the chip's blueprint
- The areas exposed to light are hardened, while
unexposed areas are then etched away by hot gases
to leave a three-dimensional microchip

#### Doping
- The electrical conductivity of different parts of
the chip can also be altered by doping them with
chemicals under heat and pressure
  - This process can be repeated hundreds of times
  for the same chip, producing a more complex
  integrated circuit at each step
- To create conducting paths between the components
a thin layer of metal such as aluminum is overlaid
onto the chip and the etching process is used to
remove everything except the thin conducting pathways
- Several layers of conductors seperated by glass
insulators can be laid down

#### Classification
- Each chip on the wafer is then tested for
performance before it's seperated from other chips
on the wafer by a saw
- Since microchips are essentially circuits built
on an incredibly small scale, they have a basic set
of components

#### Basic components of a microchip
- Capacitors can temporarily store an electrical
charge
- Resistors help control the electrical current
- Transistors can either amplify or switch the
electrical signals passing through
- For more advanced chips, like those found on
high-end graphics cards, there can be upwards of
28 billion transistors

#### Transistors on graphics cards
- More transistors on microchips allow them
to send out more instructions, increasing the
computational power
- Moore's Law predicts that computer chip
manufacturing would advance at a steady rate,
allowing transistor counts to double every two years
- Based on the sheer power of the technology we use
on a day-to-day basis, this decades-old prediction
seems to still be mostly true
- Manufacturers have been shrinking down their
transistor sizes to fit more onto chips
- Each breakthrough in transistor size has allowed
the production of more powerful chips for our phones,
computers, and gaming consoles
  - In recent years, they've gotten each transistor
  down to as small as 8x10^-8 inches (2 nanometers)
  in diameter, allowing an amazing 50 billion
  transistors to be crammed onto a single chip
