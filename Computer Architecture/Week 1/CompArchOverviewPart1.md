#### Advancement of Computing
- Today, you have more computing power in some of your
'smart' home appliances than all of NASA had when they
landed Apollo 11 on the moon.
- Ponder this for a minute and its implications

#### The Transistor
- Semiconductor device
- Used to amplify or 'switch' electronic signals
  - Does this through voltage and current controller
- Building block for digital logic, RAM, and processors.
- At one point, this is what we had

#### The Integrated Circuit (1970s)
- Includes multiple transistors on a single chip
- With machines for processing, cost plummeted
- Design was less emphasized
- Performance increase per year: 25-30%

#### The Microprocessor (late 1970s)
- An entire processor on on integrated circuit or chip
- Performance increase per year: 35%
  - Most just 'riding' the continued improvements of ICs

#### Microprocessor
- A processor which understands a specific set of instructions.
These instructions are called the *Instruction Set Architecture*
of the processor.
  - Different processors cannot understand each other's ISAs!
  This is why if you compile something on one processor and
  attempt to run it on a different processor, it won't work.

#### Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) Architectures (1980s)
- Idea: We can represent each task of the computer using a subset of a simplified set of instructions
  - Performance is salvaged by capitalizing on simplicity,
  and build our architectures to execute them as
  fast as possible
  - Examples: MIPS and SPARC
  - Performance Techniques
  - Execute multiple instructions at the same time
  - Cache recently used instructions and data in faster memory
- Performance increase per year: 50+%, and steady
- So now, what do we have...

#### Moore's Law
- The number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years
