#### Moral...
- To continue this sustained improvement in terms of
cost and performance, we need to continue not just
improving the technology to make transistors.
- But also, we need to develop the innovations in
architectural design.

#### The 'Changing Face'
- Dominant Forms of Computing
  - 1960s: Big mainframes, many operators
  - 1970s: Minicomputer and the idea of time-sharing
  - 1980s: Desktop computer and microprocessors
  - 1990s: Internet and WWW, PDAs, video games
  - 2000s: Laptop computers
  - 2010s: Laptops, phones and tables
  - 2020s: ?
- Markets and Goals
  - Desktop/Laptop Computing: Price-performance
  - Servers: Availability, scalability, and throughput
  - Embedded Systems: Low memory and low power

#### Computer Architecture
- Encompasses three things:
  - The instruction set architecture
  - High-level organization
    - CPU, memory, cache, buses
  - Hardware
    - Logic design
    - Clock rate
- The functional requirements and application are
VERY CRITICAL!
  - Personal Computers -> leading edge microprocessors
  - Server -> Integrate multiple processors,
  parallelism should scale
  - Embedded -> Deliver most of the performance at
  a lower price, while paying attention to power

#### Designing an Instruction Set
- Must be constantly 'trendy', and handle development
- Transistor count on a chip increases 55% per year
- Memory
  - Density improves quickly, 40-60% per year
  - Access time decreases slowly, 33% in ten years
  - Known as the "CPU-Memory" bottleneck
- Networks
  - Bandwidth is increasingly reasonably fast, from
  100 Mb/s Ethernet in the late 90s...today?
  - Solution: Design for the 'next' technology

#### Transistor Sizes
- Shrinking dramatically
  - From 1971 to 2001, they went from 10 microns to
  0.18 microns in length (quadratic decrease in
  density)
- Good news
  - Required operating voltage shrinks
  - Performance improves linearly
- Bad news: let's think
  - Many more transistors switching at a much higher
  frequency

#### POWER!!!
- First microprocessors: tenths of a watt
- Now? 100s of watts
