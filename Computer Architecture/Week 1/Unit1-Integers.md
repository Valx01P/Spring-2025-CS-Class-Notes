### Integers
#### (A) Unsigned Integer Number Representation

An unsigned integer number \( A \) can be represented using \( n \) digits in base \( b \) as follows:

\[
A = (a_{n-1} a_{n-2} \cdots a_2 a_1 a_0)_b
\]

In this representation (called **positional representation**), each digit \( a_i \) is given by:

Using positional representation, the decimal value of the unsigned integer number \( A \) is given by:

\[
A = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot b^i
\]

\[
0 \leq a_i \leq (b-1)
\]
