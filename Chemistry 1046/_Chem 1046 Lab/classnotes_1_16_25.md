IR Infrared Spectroscopy

- IR is an analytical tool used to identify organic
functional groups
- IR is a non-destructive vibrational technique

// IR makes a sample vibrate, it doesn't destroy it

When we look at the IR x axis, it says cm-1,
the name of the axis is wave numbers, and the
unit is inverse centimeters, the equation
for finding the wave number is 1 divided by
lambda, and lambda is the wavelength of the light

Gamma rays are the strongest radiation, that means
that it is a short wavelength, it is high energy,
high frequency, if you are hit by gamma ray you die,
it is ionizing radiation, xrays are bone cancer,
ultraviolet is skin cancer, visible isn't that
bad, infrared is considered heat, used in remotes,
then microwaves, the ones in the microwave, then
we have radio waves, infrared is the region
of light that we are going to use to do spectroscopy
and it happens that most organic compounds will
absorb infrared in this region

all organic compounds absorb infrared radiation
and their region of infrared radtion is from 2.5
micrometers to 15 micrometers, wavelength gets
longer as you go further left, 2.5 micrometers
is more energetic

let's calc the wave numbers to 2.5
convert 2.5 micrometers to wave numbers and wave
numbers is in inverse centimeters, so centimers
to the -1, wave numbers is 1/2, the wavelength
we are looking at is 2.5 micrometers, we need
to convert it to centimeters, cancel out the
micrometer, 

Atoms are bonded with electrons, every single bond
vibrates as electrons fly by atoms, they eventually
get closer to another atom and make that atom
more negative which makes the other more positive
and has it attract the other, then they repel each
other and the process repeats, the vibration
can be described by a wave, when two different
size waves collide, they create destructive
interference, waves with different frequencies
destroy each other, this is called destructive
iterferenceo, but if both waves have the same
frequency / wavelength and meet each other, they
add to each other instead of destroying each other,
this is constructive inteference

and then light comes in with the same frequency
as the vibration, the light gets absorbed,
the intensity of the light decreases as the
bond absorbs the light, when the bond does that
it vibrates more, when you use a microwave the
bonds in the water vibrate, the water absorbs
the radiation and vibrates

When an organic compound is irradiated, (ex. shined
light on it, people with cancer have been irradiated
with a specific frequency)


FORMAL STATEMENT:
When an organic compound is irradiated with a
specific IR frequency that matches a natural
vibrational frequency in the molecule, resonance
(or absorption) takes place

Bond vibrating ie vibrational frequencies, light
comes in and matches that frequency, that light
is absorbed, fancy name for that is resonance


The absorbed radiation makes the molecule vibrate,
(the molecule was vibrating before as well) as in
stretching, bending, and translating,
stretching is linear, bending is like a bend,
translating is a 3 dimensional move



Numbers for the functional groups

Functional Groups
R = Carbon Chain (1 or 2, 3, etc.)
R-OH Alcohol (all sugars have that group) 3300 cm^-1
R-NH_2 Amine (fishy smell) 3400 cm^-1
Aromatics Double Bonds (left of 3k, > 3k)
3050cm^-1 1600-1500cm^-1 
Aliphatics Single Bonds (right of 3k, < 3k)
2950cm^-1 1450-1250cm^-1
Carbonyl 1700 cm^-1
Below 1250 cm^-1, Fingerprint

Nothing ever comes out of 3000 on the IR,
if there are a bunch of peaks on the left, those
are aromatics, if they are on the right, they are
aliphatics
