at the phase transition both phases are at
equilibrium, ex. solid & liquid

eventually the temp stops increasing and
stays constant so the intermolecular forces
are breaking

endothermic, positive heat, positive delta
^ needs energy to break intermolecular forces
^ to make a liquid into a gas, you have to
^ add heat, so it requires energy, therefore
^ there is positive heat / energy, delta +
^ sublimation

exothermic, negative heat, negative delta
^ releases energy
^ to make gas into a liquid, it releases
^ energy, delta h is less than 0,
^ intermolecular forces are building
^ liquid to solid is also delta h negative
^ deposition

sugar is non-volatile, it never boils
non-volatile means it does not go into
the gas phase, volatile means it goes
into the gas phase very easily, it has
low boiling points,

steam is releasing energy on your skin
as it condenses on you, therefore burning
you

def: boiling point,
when the vapor pressure is equal to atmospheric
pressure, the amount of molecules that escape
the liquid as it heats, creates vapor pressure,
you can compare vapor pressure to boiling point
and vapor pressure to intermolecular forces,
more molecules escaping, means more vapor pressure

higher vapor pressure, lower boiling point
lower vapor pressure, higher boiling point

acetone has a boiling point of 56
water has a boiling point of 100 something

acetone can be smelled better because it
has a higher vapor pressure, if something
has a lower boiling point it is more volatile
and can be smelled easier, volatile means
something can go to the gas phase easier

-20 boiling point would be something that really
doesn't want to be a liquid

phase diagram

pressure in atmospheres (atm)(y axis)
temperature in celsius (c)(x axis)

super critical fluid, like water, but
at very high speeds like a gas,
critical point

H2O slopes to the left on the phase diagram
because solid water is less dense than liquid water,
and that's caused by h-bonds and is why ice floats,
it has more space in the solid form within its
molecules

over 1 atm, a melting point is not normal,
so we don't consider it, the temperature
for the triple point is where the liquid,
solid, and gas phases are all present
