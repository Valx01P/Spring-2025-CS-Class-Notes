##### Intermolecular Forces, Liquids, Solids and Phase Changes

- Physical properties of substances understood in terms of kinetic
molecular theory
  - Gases are highly compressible, assumes shape and volume of container:
    - Gas molecules are far apart and do not interact much with each other
  - Liquids are almost incompressible, assume the shape but not the volume
  of container:
    - Liquids molecules are held close together than gas molecules, but
    not so rigidly that the molecules cannot slide past each other.
  - Solids are incompressible and have a definite shape and volume:
    - Solid molecules are packed closely together. The molecules are so
    rigidly packed that they cannot easily slide past each other

##### Some characteris properties of the states of matter
- Gas:
  - Assumes both the volume and shape of its container is compressible
  - Flows readily
  - Diffusion within a gas occurs rapidly
- Liquid:
  - Assumes the shape of the portion of the container it occupies
  - Does not expand to fill container
  - Is virtually incompressible
  - Flows readily
  - Diffusion within a liquid occurs slowly
- Solid:
  - Retains its own shape and volume
  - Is virtually incompressible
  - Does not flow
  - Diffusion within a solid occurs extremely slowly

---

- Converting a gas into a liquid or solid requires the molecules to get
closer to each other:
  - cool or compress
- Converting a solid into a liquid or gas requires the molecules to move
further apart:
  - heat or reduce pressure

---

##### The forces holding solids and liquids together are called:
intermolecular forces

---

#### Intermolecular Forces

- The covalent bond holding a molecule together is an **intramolecular** force.
- The attraction between molecules is an **intermolecular force**.
- Intermolecular forces are much weaker than intramolecular forces
(e.g. 16 kJ/mol vs. 431 kJ/mol for HCl).
- When a substance melts or boils the intermolecular forces are broken
(not the covalent bonds).
